    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...<br>
    The moon was full, but streaked with thick clouds.<br>
    The air was thick with storm and the pavement slick from the rain.
  </p>
    <p>Meanwhile the gods were talking:
    <b> "I wonder if this code will ever work properly!" </b> said ______ the goddess
     of _______.<br>
    <b> "I'm probably breaking it! But what are we going to do with this cloudy scene? 
      Should we put Hugo in it?" </b> said erinous the goddess of congestion.</b>
